INTERN ID : CT04DR2874

DOMAIN : JAVA PROGRAMMING

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION OF TASK : During this internship, four Java based tasks were completed using Eclipse IDE to understand core programming concepts and real world application development.
Task 1: File Handling Utility
This task focuses on creating a Java program that can read, write, and modify text files. It helps in understanding how Java handles files and data storage. The program demonstrates basic file operations such as creating a file, writing content into it, and reading the stored data.
Task 2: REST API Client
In this task, a Java application is developed to consume a public REST API. The program sends HTTP requests, receives data in JSON format, and displays the information in a structured way. This task introduces how applications interact with external web services.
Task 3: Multithreaded Chat Application
This task involves building a basic chat application using Java where multiple users can communicate at the same time. It uses multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously, helping to understand concurrency and real-time communication concepts.
Task 4: AI-Based Recommendation System
A simple recommendation system is implemented using Java. The program suggests products or items to users based on preferences or ratings given by other users. This task introduces basic artificial intelligence and decision making logic.

These tasks together improve understanding of Java fundamentals, file handling, API communication, multithreading, and AI concepts. The internship provides hands-on experience in building practical applications using Java.
